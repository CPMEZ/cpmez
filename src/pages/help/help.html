  <h2>How to Use Care Planning Made Easy</h2>

  <h1 id='templates'>Create Care Plans faster with templates</h1>
  <p>Templates provide a quick and easy way to include most-used content in your care plans, while enabling
    individual patient specificity.</p>

  <p>To create templates, follow these steps.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From My Care Plans, choose <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW PLAN</span>. We suggest naming your plan something
      easy
      to find later, such as 'CHF Template'. You may want to name all your templates so that they appear in the same
      section of Care Plans, such as 'Template <em>(condition)</em>.' You may also add a description.</li>
    <li>Once added, the newly-created plan will appear at the end of your My Care Plans list. Tap to open.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To develop your template, create topics, outcomes and interventions.</p>
  <p class='confirm'>See the Add Guided Care Plan option for a suggested organization of care topics.</p>
  <ul>Using the upper left menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon>:
    <li>Add a Care Topic to the plan. Care topics may be problems, disciplines, or simply care
      focus areas.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat until you've covered the desired set of topics.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>Using the menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> to the right of each Care Topic:
    <li>Add and edit outcomes for the topic. Add blanks into the text to allow tailoring of outcomes to each patient,
      as needed. It is best practice to give an explicit goal date, for example, so it would be appropriate to leave
      space for a date. </li>
    <li>Add and edit interventions for the topic. Add blanks into the text to allow tailoring of interventions to each
      patient, as needed.
    </li>
    <li>When your changes are complete and the template plan is satisfactory, you're all done. No need to save
      explicitly, the app will save at intervals as you work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To begin planning for an individual patient, copy a template first.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From My Care Plans, choose <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW CARE PLAN</span>.</li>
    <li>On the Add a Care Plan Page, name the new plan. The name can be anything you like, but we suggest using care to
      observe patient privacy concerns. [See the <span class='hilite'>Patient Privacy Note</span>.]</li>
    <li>Note the 'Add' and 'Copy' buttons will be disabled if the new name duplicates an old name. The buttons become
      available immediately, as you type, if the new name hasn't been used before.</li>
    <li>Choose <span class='hilite'>Copy One of My Plans.</span></li>
    <li>Select the Template you want to use for your patient. You will have the opportunity to preview and select the
      contents you want before saving.</li>
    <li>You will be returned to the My Care Plans page. You'll need to find the new one
      you just created before proceeding (it will be at the bottom of your list of plans).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Open the new plan (tap on it's name to open its contents), then change topics, outcomes, or interventions
    to meet your individual patient's needs. Fill in the blanks to provide necessary specifics.</p>
  <p>We also suggest you add all your co-morbid conditions for a patient at the same time, because the app will remove
    any duplication as you merge in additional templates. You're then able to refine your resulting plan thereafter.</p>
  <p>To plan for patients with more than one condition, you can merge in other care plans. Ideally, these would be
    other templates you have created.</p>
  <p>To merge in one of your Plans:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the new plan if it's not alreaedy open.</li>
    <li>Tap the menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> icon </li>
    <li>Choose Add from My Plan</li>
    <li>Select the desired plan from the Select list.</li>
    <li>Choose your preferred contents from the preview. <span class='hilite'>SAVE</span> when ready.</li>
    <li>Proceed with adding, removing or modifying topics, outcomes, or interventions as needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Merging Notes: topics, outcomes, and interventions that are not in the plan are added. Those that are
    already in the plan will not be added again.</p>
  <p>The merge compares topics, outcomes, and interventions exactly, letter for letter. If you've filled in some blanks
    in an item, that
    item will no longer match a like item exactly, and therefore will present again. This is a good reason to do all
    your merging first, and do your individualizing care after.</p>
  <p>When merging in a second condition or additional disciplines, the app will expand the care topic
    into which items were merged (in the Care Plan page), as a way of showing you where content was added.</p>
  <p>Consider making multiple templates to apply to the most common conditions you encounter in your practice.</p>
  <p>You may also choose to make co-morbid or multi-condition templates. To do so, simply add the set of topics,
    outcomes, and interventions that apply to those conditions. For example, you may have a Diabetes-Hypertension
    Template, or a Cancer-Opiod Management Template.</p>

  <h1 id='privacy'>Patient Privacy Note</h1>
  <p>As health care professionals, we expect to maintain utmost confidentiality in treating patients' private
    information. In most countries, laws protect patient privacy, and many provide for severe penalties for violating
    this trust. Care Planning Made Easy strongly recommends you do not identify care plans with individual patient names, or
    any other protected health information. We suggest using a mnemonic of some kind instead. As the basic idea behind the
    app is to enable you to compose plans to be easily inserted into some other documentation or documentation system, we suggest
    you identify the plan to the specific patient only in the context of a separate, secure system.</p>
  <h1 id='quick'>Quick Guide</h1>
  <h1 id='more'>On Every Page</h1>
  <p>A heading at the top of the page tells you which page you’re on. </p>
  <p>Back option: Most pages will have a Back option, an arrow pointing to the left, at the left side of the
    heading. Use this to return to the previous page. On pages where you're adding or editing, 'back' will work just
    like
    'cancel'.</p>
  <p>Help: Most pages will have a help, '?'
    <ion-icon name='help'></ion-icon> icon with which you can reach this help page. Of course you already knew that,
    or you wouldn’t be here.
  </p>

  <h1>The Welcome Page</h1>
  <p>This is the page you see first when the app starts.</p>
  <h2 id='start'>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Tap <span class='hilite'>CONTINUE</span> to get started.</p>
  <p>On your first visit, your <span class='hilite'>My Care Plans</span> page will be empty, nearly blank. This is
    normal; this is the page where all your plans are listed, and of course you don't have any yet! You'll start with
    the
    big blue <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW PLAN</span> button. See how to create a plan below.</p>

  <h2>My Care Plans Page</h2>
  <p>This is your home page.</p>
  <p>On this page, all your care plans are listed. You will normally start out with an empty list, before
    you create your first plan. Listed plans may be templates you've created to be copied (see above,) or plans you've
    written for individual patients (see Patient Privacy note and <span (click)='terms()'>terms
      and conditions</span>.)</p>
  <p>There's a big blue <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW PLAN</span> button at the top of the page. Select
    that button to create a new plan, whether you intend to make a template or an individual patient's plan.</p>
  <p>Each plan listed on the page is identified by the name you gave when you created it. Following the
    name, there is an icon
    <ion-icon name='create' class='tool'></ion-icon>. Tap anywhere on the name or
    <ion-icon name='create' class='tool'></ion-icon>, to work with the Care Plan, including changing its name,
    copying it, deleting it, adding or changing contents, or sharing the plan.
  </p>

  <h2>(specific) Care Plan Page</h2>
  <p>Where all the work happens. The plan you selected on My Care Plans Page is shown. The name of the plan
    appears at the top. To the left of the plan name is a menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> icon.</p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='shuffle'></ion-icon> Add from My Plan, used to merge one of your other plans into this plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='add'></ion-icon>Add Care Topic
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='share'></ion-icon>Share, opens the Text Care Plan Page, from which you may clipboard, email, or
    make a PDF of your plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='trash'></ion-icon>Delete, after confirmation, will remove the care plan permanently.
  </p>
  <p>Below the name, care topics are listed in red. These topics may be aspects of care, physiology, disciplines,
    or other focus areas. This area will be blank initially, as you are creating a new plan. Each care topic has an
    option on the left to expand <ion-icon name='arrow-dropright'></ion-icon> or collapse <ion-icon name='arrow-dropdown'></ion-icon> its
    content, to enable easier navigation. The topics are listed in the order they were added to the plan.
  </p>
  <p>On the right of each Topic is a menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> option to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name='star'></ion-icon> Add an Outcome
    </li>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name='construct'></ion-icon> Add an Intervention
    </li>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name='trash'></ion-icon> Delete this Topic
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When expanded, outcomes and interventions related to the care topic are listed. Outcomes are listed
    first in Green, followed by interventions in Blue.
  </p>
  <p>Both outcomes and interventions are listed in the order originally entered. You can drag and drop to
    rearrange outcomes or interventions within their topics, and within that screen view. (That is, the screen won't
    scroll while dragging.)
  </p>
  <p>Outcomes may indicate short or long term with “ST” or “LT” preceding the outcome text. Interventions may indicate
    the applicable discipline(s), listed after the intervention text.
  </p>
  <p>Each has a Delete <ion-icon name='trash'></ion-icon> option to the right of the item.
  </p>
